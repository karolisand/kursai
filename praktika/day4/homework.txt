Homework:

Modify guess_game_extended.py:
1. Add command 'quit' which would exit the game while playing. Please print "Thank you for playing"
(you enter that after 'Please enter your guess')

2. Task: Simple Unit Converter

Create a program that asks the user for a distance in kilometers and converts it to miles.
- 1 mile is approximately 1.60934 kilometers.

Your program should:
- Ask the user to input a distance in kilometers
- Convert the input to a number
- Calculate the equivalent distance in miles
- Print the result in a user-friendly format (e.g., "X kilometers is Y miles.")
- Include error handling for invalid input (e.g., if the user enters text instead of a number)

This task will allow practice of:
- input() for user data
- print() for displaying information
- Type conversion (e.g., float())
- Basic arithmetic operations
- try-except for error handling
- Variable assignment

3. Optional for Advanced Students (self-learning task).
   Investigate library 'Rich' and make prompts more UI friendly.
